## TIL
- There's [preview mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_preview-mode) enabled in VS Code by default, but it's possible to disable it for `Quick Open` action with `workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen` property to open new files in new tab
- In some languages (e.g. Java) it is possible to access private members of a class from a different instance of the same class
